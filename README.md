# Drum Loop Genre Classification with CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying drum loop genres. The project utilizes `pipenv` for package management and `torch` for neural networks.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone this repo
    cd mlp_genre_classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies using `pipenv`:
    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```sh
    pipenv shell
    ```

## Usage

To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9^
- pipenv
- torch
